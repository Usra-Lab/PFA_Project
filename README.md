Welcome to the  Auction System repository! This application is a robust and feature-rich Auction System developed using Angular, Spring Boot, MySQL, and managed through Git. This README provides an overview of the application's technical aspects, roles, and core functionalities.

## Technical Roles

The  Auction System involved various technical roles, each contributing to the successful development of the application:

1. **Conception**: This phase included creating essential artifacts like Conceptual Data Models (MCDs), Class Diagrams, Use Cases, and Sequence Diagrams. It helped define the structure and relationships within the application.

2. **Structuring the Project**: The project was meticulously organized using the Data Access Object (DAO) model, ensuring efficient data management and accessibility.

3. **Implementation**: The codebase was built with an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach for the backend, while the frontend followed a component-based programming paradigm.

4. **API Testing with Postman**: Extensive testing was carried out using the Postman tool to validate and verify the functionality of the APIs.

5. **Frontend-Backend Communication**: A seamless communication channel was established between the frontend and backend, ensuring smooth data flow.

## Application Features

- **Authentication**: Verification of user identity during login.
- **Authorization**: Definition of access rules based on user roles (User/Admin).

### Auction Space

The application includes a dedicated space for auctions, offering the following functionalities:

- **Publish Auctions**: Users can effortlessly publish auctions, including the ability to modify or remove items.
- **Admin Validation**: An admin panel is provided for validating auction listings.
### Bidding Zone

The development of a bidding zone allows users to:

- **Submit Bids**: Users can propose prices on items available for auction.

## Technologies Used

- **Angular**: Used for building the frontend components.
- **Spring Boot**: Empowered the backend with Java-based development.
- **MySQL**: The database management system for storing essential data.
- **Git**: Version control system for efficient collaboration and code management.

## Conclusion

The  Auction System is a comprehensive and secure platform for managing online auctions. Its adherence to modern web technologies, robust authentication, and versatile auction features make it an ideal choice for users looking to host or participate in online auctions.
